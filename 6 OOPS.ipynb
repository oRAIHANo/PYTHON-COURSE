    "# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects\".\n",
    "# Which can contain data in the form of attributes (variables) and code in the form of methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objects for Managing Data:\n",
    "# Objects encapsulate data by bundling together related attributes into a single entity. \n",
    "# These attributes represent the state or characteristics of the object. \n",
    "# For example, in a Car class, attributes like brand, model, and color represent the data associated with each car object. \n",
    "# By organizing data into objects, OOP enables a more intuitive and organized way to represent complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods for Manipulating Data:\n",
    "# Methods, on the other hand, are functions defined within a class that operate on the data contained within objects. \n",
    "# These functions encapsulate behaviors or operations that can be performed on the data. \n",
    "# Car class example, methods like display_info and change_color manipulate the data associated with car objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, objects manage data by encapsulating related attributes.\n",
    "# While methods manipulate that data by providing operations and behaviors that can be performed on it. "

    "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. \n",
    "# It defines the attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have. \n",
    "# In Python, you can define a class using the class keyword followed by the class name. Here's a basic example:\n",
    "# class MyClass:\n",
    "#     def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "#         self.x = x\n",
    "\n",

    "# obj1 = MyClass(5)\n",
    "# obj2 = MyClass(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "# It enables you to use a single interface for different data types or classes.\n",
    "# Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding or method overloading. Here's an example of method overriding:\n",
    "# class Animal:\n",
    "#     def sound(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# class Dog(Animal):\n",

    "# class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "#     def sound(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Polymorphic behavior\n",
    "# animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "# for animal in animals:\n",
    "#     animal.sound()\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Encapsulation in Python:\n",
    "# Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., class). \n",
    "# It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data. \n",
    "# In Python, encapsulation can be achieved by using private variables and methods, denoted by a leading underscore. \n",
    "# Here's an example:\n",
    "# class MyClass:\n",
    "#     def __init__(self):\n",
    "#         self._data = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "#     def _private_method(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"This is a private method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# obj = MyClass()\n",
    "# print(obj._data)  # Accessing private variable (not recommended)\n",
    "# obj._private_method()  # Calling private method (not recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance in Python:\n",
    "# Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from anotherclass. \n",
    "# The class from which a subclass inherits is called the superclass or parent class. \n",
    "# In Python, you can achieve inheritance by passing the superclass as a parameter in the class definition.\n",
    "# Here's an example:\n",
    "# class Vehicle:\n",
    "#     def drive(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"Vehicle is being driven\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "#     def accelerate(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"Car is accelerating\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Car inherits from Vehicle\n",
    "# car = Car()\n",
    "# car.drive()  # Output: Vehicle is being driven\n",
    "# car.accelerate()  # Output: Car is accelerating\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Abstraction in Python:\n",
    "# Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. \n",
    "# It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. \n",
    "# In Python, data abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and methods from the abc (Abstract Base Classes)module.\n",
    "# Here's an example:\n",
    "# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "# class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "#     @abstractmethod\n",
    "#     def area(self):\n",
    "#         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "#     def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "#         self.width = width\n",
    "#         self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "#     def area(self):\n",
    "#         return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Shape cannot be instantiated directly\n",
    "# # shape = Shape()  # Raises TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Rectangle is a subclass of Shape and implements the area method\n",
    "# rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)\n",
    "# print(\"Area of Rectangle:\", rectangle.area())  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "# These are the fundamental OOP concepts in Python.\n",
    "# Understanding and utilizing these concepts will help you write cleaner, more organized, and maintainable code."
